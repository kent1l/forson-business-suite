Create a document explorer interface for viewing historical transaction documents (GRN, Sales, Invoice, Purchase Orders) with the following specifications:

1. UI/UX Requirements:
- Implement a modern, responsive grid/list layout
- Use existing project design system and components
- Follow established styling patterns and color schemes
- Ensure consistent spacing and typography
- Add clear visual hierarchy for document types

2. Core Features:
- Document filtering by type (GRN, Sales, INV, PO)
- Date range selection
- Search functionality for document numbers/references
- Sort options (date, type, reference number)
- Quick preview/detail view toggle
- Pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets

3. Navigation Structure:
- Breadcrumb navigation showing current location
- Left sidebar for document type categories
- Main content area for document listing
- Right panel for document preview/details

4. Document Display:
- Show key metadata (date, type, reference, status)
- Thumbnail/icon indicating document type
- Clear CTAs for document actions (view, download, share)
- Loading states and error handling

5. Performance Considerations:
- Implement lazy loading for document lists
- Cache frequently accessed documents
- Optimize image/preview loading
- Handle large document sets efficiently

All implementations must follow existing project architecture patterns and coding standards.
